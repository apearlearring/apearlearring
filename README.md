I am excited to apply for this position at your esteemed organization. With over 8 years of experience as a passionate and skilled Machine Learning Engineer, I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team.

Throughout my career, I have honed my expertise in designing, developing, and deploying cutting-edge LLM-based pipelines that leverage advanced patterns such as RAG, agentic workflows, and PEFT (e.g., LoRa, QLoRa). My deep understanding of the entire machine learning lifecycle has enabled me to consistently deliver high-performing and scalable solutions.
